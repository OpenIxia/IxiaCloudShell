# Ixia-CloudShell content installer

This project contains a detailed procedure and necessary artifacts to load Ixia's demo content on an existing CloudShell deployment.

The demo content includes a CloudShell suite with few IxNetwork tests, which is associated to a virtual blueprint including IxVM, IxNetwork controller, two IxVM-IxNetwork tier1 licenses and a virtual router DUT (VyOS).

When launching the demo suite the sandbox is being setup, licenses check out, VMs deployed and connected and then the tests are launched sequentially. When the suite ends the test results and reports are available in CloudShell portal.

Please follow the installation procedure defined in the "Ixia-CloudShell content installation procedure.docx" document.
